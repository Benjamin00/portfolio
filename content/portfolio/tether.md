## The Background
I founded this company while I was studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Taking the courseload I was taking required me spending a lot of time outside of class doing homework, and I found myself only spending time with people I had already known before going to University.

I was speaking with a friend of mine about the current state of my personal life, and how I had discovered difficulty in finding new organizations and clubs to join. At the time, and perhaps still to this day, the listing for organizations at UT Austin was a simple alphabetized list posted online. Many of the clubs, I found, had long been dissolved, or the contact emails and information had failed to be updated since their inception.

Then my friend said: "what if you made kind of a Tinder but for organizations and people?" and Tether was born

## The Idea
> The best way to match people to communities is through mutual interests.
While using Tether, users are presented with a list of organizations based on best fit.
This fit is defined by the how many of the users’ interests correlate to the community,
and how well they correlate with the interests of current members within said
community. In doing so, we’re reflecting the idea that communities are not only
defined by its values as a whole; the personality of a community is the aggregate
personality of its members. Overall, this makes the discovery process simple and
manageable for the user.

*Tether Value Proposition - 2016*

The business idea was immediately appreciated by people we knew who were trying to recruit for their organizations, and we went about immediately looking for someone with slightly more web development experience, as neither of us has done more work with CS. The user experience as I envisioned it would be one where any user could simply visit the website, select general topics and themes that they would be the most interested in, and then be given a list of active organizations tailored to their interests. For example, a user might select: *Co-Ed*, *Outdoors*, *Hiking*, *Casual* and may be presented with organizations they didn't know exited, like the UT Hammocking Club, or the UT Fly Fishing Club.

## What I Learned
This was a very busy time in my life, I learned that there was no going halfway when creating a startup. My colleagues were talented, hardworking, and passionate about this idea that we were creating together. Furthermore, I learned that no one is going to tell you what you need to be doing, the work and priorities need to be communcated between all the parties. Lastly, I learned that I didn't have time to be worried about public speaking, or presenting under high pressure scenarios. 

Once we had a somewhat working MVP and value proposition, we ended up going through a friends and family funding round, and pitching our ideas to leaders of tech companies. I think they might have seen what we didn't see at the time, that our inexperience
