#### My name is Benjamin Hill

I was born in Austin, Texas and have since lived in Seattle, Washington and Munich, Germany. Through my travels, I've become fluent in German, and have an intermediate knowledge of French. My hobbies include rowing, which I did in high-school, competitively. They also include making music. I have production credit on several songs gaining traction in the Austin area.

I have a diverse background both personally and professionally. At the University of Texas at Austin I developed a strong Mechanical Engineering skill set before transferring to Geography to learn more about sustainability, and big data with GIS. I also started a company to reduce the pain points of joining organizations in college. I graduated UT Austin early, and went on to immediately pursue a degree in computer science.

As of August of 2019, I have finished that degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I joined the UT Dallas chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). At ACM, I went on to build websites, mentor students, and spearhead new programs to challenge the more advanced students at the University.

I chose computer science because I believe it gives me a valuable set of tools. Having the fundamental skills, and basis of understanding for Computer Science allows me the freedom to rapidly experiment and learn any new tech skills I might be interested in. This, in turn, allows me to independently develop solutions addressing the bigger issues we face today, which is something that I'm passionate about doing. 

I've been working at Indeed the job search website for going on 2 years. During this time I've been mentored and become a mentor myself. I've worked on high impact projects, improving the experience of both employers and people looking for jobs, with project impact reaching over 1M+ people.


Best,

Benjamin
