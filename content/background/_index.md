#### My name is Benjamin Hill

I was born in Austin, Texas and have since lived in Seattle, Washington and Munich, Germany. Through my travels, I've become fluent in German, and have an intermediate knowledge of French. My hobbies include rowing, which I did in high-school, competitively. They also include making music. In fact, I have production credit on several released songs popular in the Austin area.

I have a diverse background both personally and professionally. At the University of Texas at Austin I developed a strong Mechanical Engineering skill set before transferring to Geography to learn more about sustainability, and big data with GIS. I also started a company to reduce the pain points of joining organizations in college. I graduated UT Austin early, and went on to immediately pursue a degree in computer science.

As of August of 2019, I have finished that degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I joined the UT Dallas chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). At ACM, I went on to build websites, mentor students, and spearhead new programs to challenge the more advanced students at the University.

Additionally, during this time, I was accepted to attend Stanford's "Treehacks" hackathon where I formed a team to developed a website that went on to get a runner up prize for "Best Civic Engagement". Lastly, during my senior year my team built an open source drone capable of dodging projectiles, winning second place overall in the Senior Design Competition out of a total 52 teams.

I chose computer science because I believe it gives me a valuable set of tools. Technology is rapidly accelerating. As an example I built this portfolio website over the course of an afternoon and had it hosted and online by the evening. Having skills like that allows me the freedom to experiment, and learn quickly any new tech related skills I might be interested in. It also allows me to independently try and develop solutions to address some of the bigger issues we face today, which is something that I'm passionate about doing. 

Iâ€™m looking for a position somewhere where I can be given responsibilities and challenged. I've worked and excelled in both startup environments and stable companies. I'm always eager to learn, and ready to accept feedback.

Best,

Benjamin
