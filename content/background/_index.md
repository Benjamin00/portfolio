#### My name is Benjamin Hill

I was born in Austin, Texas and have since lived in Seattle, Washington and Munich, Germany. Through my travels, I've become fluent in German, and have an intermediate knowledge of French. My hobbies include rowing, which I did competitively in high-school, and making music. I have even have production credit on several songs from local Austin artists!

I have a diverse background both personally and professionally. At the University of Texas at Austin I developed a strong Mechanical Engineering skill set before transferring to Geography to learn more about big data, and sustainability, and how to map it using Geographic Information Systems. I also started a company to reduce the pain points of joining organizations in college. I graduated UT Austin early, and went on to pursue a degree in computer science, which I completed in an additional one and a half years at the University of Texas at Dallas.

After graduation I began working at [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com). I spent three years at Indeed. During this time I created the job editing page, the job publishing feature, new tools to reduce impact of bias and barriers for job seekers. I've also spent a great deal of my free time developing tools for other engineers to use, including new setup scripts for plugin components, and tools to generate design review documents in line with the internal design review guild's best practices.

I chose computer science because I believe it gives me a valuable set of tools. Having the fundamental skills, and basis of understanding for Computer Science allows me the freedom to rapidly experiment and learn any new tech skills I might be interested in. This, in turn, allows me to independently develop solutions addressing the bigger issues we face today, which is something that I'm passionate about doing.

Thanks for reading!
